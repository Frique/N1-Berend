I was like "What? I can style a mac app with CSS? Yes, plz."
So here's version 1.0 as the result of a double weekend project.

This theme has been tested on OSX 10.10.5, in N1 version 0.3.45.

### Instructions
- [Install N1](https://www.nylas.com/n1)
- [Download the theme](https://github.com/Frique/N1-Berend/releases)
- Visit the N1 settings
- Open the "Select theme" dropdown, select "Install a theme" and point to the downloaded folder

### Issues
- Check back here if your issue has been fixed in the newest version
- Open a github issue

### Todo
- Test on Windows
- Responsive tweaks: Narrower sidebar width
- Styling changes when window is not focused
- Account list item hover style
- Translatable button captions?
- RTL support
- Style popovers
- Style dropdowns
- Better utilization of the global variables
- Better thread list padding when the core allows styling it with CSS
